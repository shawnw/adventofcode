Advent Of Code programs.

AoC is a code challenge with a 2-part problem each day counting up to Christmas.
Hosted at http://adventofcode.com Refer to it for details about the problems these programs are
meant to solve.

Most of these programs are meant to be compiled like so:

% g++ -O -std=c++14 -o dayXX dayXX.cc

and run like

% ./dayXX < dayXX.txt

though a few don't have input files.
