# Advent Of Code 2020 Solutions

Mostly using Chicken 5.2 so far. Sometimes using other languages for
alternative solutions.

Unless otherwise mentioned, programs expect problem input on standard input.

Extra eggs that need to be installed with `chicken-install` to allow
all the scripts to run:

* srfi-1
* srfi-13
* srfi-25
* srfi-158
